    <h1>Exploring Spotify Listening Data in Various Cities Around the World</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The consumption and production of music is a global phenomenon that has been studied extensively in recent years. However, there is still much to be learned about popular music tracks and genres across different countries. In this paper, we aim to explore the listening behavior of popular music tracks and genres across the 63 countries that Spotify serves using visualization techniques.</p>

<p>The visualization will support music industry professionals, researchers, and music enthusiasts who are interested in gaining insight into how music is consumed across the world. By understanding the behavior and trends in different countries, we can better understand the preferences and cultural influences of music listeners and create more effective music marketing strategies. Additionally, by examining the differences in music preferences across countries, we can gain insight into the diversity of music tastes around the world.</p>

<p>The data we will visualize includes Spotifyâ€™s top 50 tracks and their respective genres across 63 countries. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to the broader understanding of global culture and music consumption. Understanding the musical preferences and listening behavior of people across the world is crucial to fostering cultural exchange and appreciation. Therefore, this research is not only important to the music industry but also to the broader understanding of global culture and music consumption.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        The data we utilized to develop our tool is compiled into this dataset: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS4200-S23-Class/project-nick-nino-krish/master/data/playlist.csv]
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>The data visualized in our tool comes from the Spotify API, accessed on February 1st, 2023. We collected the top 50 tracks from daily playlists across all 63 Spotify countries, and verified the available markets through an API call. The data includes various attributes such as playlist id, playlist name, track id, track name, popularity rating, added date, artist, and track metrics like duration, energy, acoustics, liveliness, tempo, etc. Then, some extraneous values that were pulled in the country of
            origin were removed, such as playlist id, track id, album, and other
            track metadata.</p>

<p>Potential biases and ethical concerns associated with this data include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cultural bias: Ensuring data is representative of all cultures in the dataset.</li>
  <li>Privacy considerations: Handling music streaming data responsibly and respecting users' privacy.</li>
  <li>Gender bias: Ensuring data is not biased towards any particular gender or gender expression.</li>
  <li>Corporate influence: Recognizing and accounting for the influence of corporate interests on popular music data.</li>
</ul>
